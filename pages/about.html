        <h2>Welcome to Adventure.Travel, The Global Sustainable Adventure Travel Storytelling Ecosystem</h2>
        <h1>Adventure.Travel is for Travelers</h1>
        <p>Adventure.Travel makes dreaming and planning for travel better. By sharing stories from real-life travel professionals, we aim to making travel planning easier by telling the stories of places that are actually good to travel. So many times we have found that flipping through social media showcases places that are fundamentally not good to travel to â€” because of overtourism, lack of infrastructure, or just pure quality. So we firmly believe that by sourcing stories from tour operators, travel writers, and the travel community, that it will lead to a better trip for you. How can we do that? It's because we are powered by the ATTA, the hub of the adventure travel industry. We hope you enjoy your stay. If you like what you see, would you consider signing up for our newsletter or following on social?</p>
