        <h1>Tunisia</h1>

        <p>
            A small country in North Africa, Tunisia has always managed to preserve its legendary hospitality and its
            sweet way of life. Images come to mind when we talk about it: white houses, the ever-present sun, tea with
            pine nuts or orange blossom coffee as a welcome, smiles, oases, and the poetry of Tunisians always eager to
            bring beauty to everyday life.

            In terms of landscapes, it is known and recognized for its beaches and the numerous hotels that line them;
            1300 kilometers of coastline certainly don't go unnoticed! Much less known are its inland areas and
            historical heritage! In more remote places, age-old traditions persist through magnificent craftsmanship.
            Exploring them leads to unique encounters.

            A new wind is blowing over the country, finally turning towards its natural treasures, opening new paths to
            explore mountains, caves, the gates of the Sahara, still-preserved wilderness, and confidential
            archaeological sites.

            Hospitality takes an alternative form with the construction of eco-lodges using ancestral building
            techniques. Outdoor activities are gaining popularity: spelunking, hiking, mountain biking, and a whole
            generation of nature guides trained by experts. This land, filled with light and hidden treasures, finally
            offers explorer-travelers a range of sports and multiple discoveries. Welcome to a Tunisia off the beaten
            path, against the current, more authentic.

                        Northwest Tunisia
                        Located about a hundred kilometers from the capital, Tunis, Northwestern Tunisia is full of lesser-known lands rich in history. The city of Kef nestles at an altitude of over 600 meters, and it is not without charm with its multi-level construction. The view from its Ottoman fortress is breathtaking. A vast mountainous territory, the peaks of the Atlas range can reach over 1000 meters and are covered with a thick forest of pine, cork oak, and holm oak trees. Rivers and lakes formed by dams abound. People come to Kef to experience its pure air, hike in pristine nature, engage in trail running on the Tunisian Dorsale, especially on the Jugurtha Table, explore the pine woods, and relax along a river or on the shores of the lake in the Nebeur forest. Not to forget its Roman archaeological sites like Althiburos, which recall Tunisia's rich history.
